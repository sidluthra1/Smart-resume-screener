We’re looking for a Software Engineer to join our growing product team and help us build out
the Smart Resume Screener platform. You’ll work closely with our frontend, backend and AI

Responsibilities:
- Design, implement and maintain RESTful APIs in Java (Spring Boot) for uploading resumes
  and job descriptions.
- Collaborate with frontend engineers building React/Tailwind interfaces.
- Integrate a BERT‑based NLP pipeline for semantic matching between resumes and job text.
- Write clean, well‑tested code; participate in code reviews and pair‑programming.
- Help define and track metrics (match score accuracy, performance, coverage).

Requirements:
- Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience.
- 3+ years of professional Java/Spring Boot development.
- Familiarity with Python for AI/ML scripting (e.g. using pdfplumber, python‑docx).
- Experience with NLP concepts (semantic similarity, TF‑IDF, embeddings).
- Strong problem‑solving skills and attention to detail.
- Excellent communication and teamwork abilities.
